# Gradient Boosting Variants Overview

This repository/documentation provides an overview of the most popular Gradient Boosting variants used for classification and regression tasks in machine learning.

## What is Gradient Boosting?

Gradient Boosting is an ensemble learning technique that builds models sequentially by optimizing a loss function. Each new model corrects the errors of the previous models. It is highly effective for both classification and regression problems, especially with structured/tabular data.
