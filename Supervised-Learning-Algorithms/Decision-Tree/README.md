# Decision Tree Models

This section covers the implementation of Decision Tree algorithms for both **Classification** and **Regression** tasks using `scikit-learn`.

## Overview

Decision Trees are supervised learning algorithms used for classification and regression tasks. They model decisions as a series of conditions, splitting data at each node based on feature thresholds to achieve the most information gain.

## Variants Covered

### 1. Decision Tree Classifier
- Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset
- Task: Classify tumors as malignant or benign
- Metrics: Accuracy, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix
- Visualization: Seaborn heatmap for the confusion matrix

### 2. Decision Tree Regressor
- Dataset: California Housing Dataset
- Task: Predict median house prices
- Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), RÂ² Score
- Visualization: Scatter plot of Actual vs Predicted values
