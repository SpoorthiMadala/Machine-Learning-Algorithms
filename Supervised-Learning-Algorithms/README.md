# Supervised Learning Algorithms

This folder contains implementations and demonstrations of various supervised machine learning algorithms. Supervised learning involves training models on labeled datasets, where each input sample is paired with a corresponding output label. The objective is to learn a mapping function that can accurately predict outputs for new, unseen data.

## Contents

Each algorithm is organized in its own subfolder containing:

- A Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) illustrating the algorithm with practical examples.  
- A dedicated `README.md` file explaining the algorithmâ€™s theory, mathematical foundation, and typical use cases.  
- Supporting scripts or modules as necessary.

## Algorithms Included

- Linear Regression  
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Trees  
- Random Forests  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Naive Bayes  
- Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)  
- XGBoost  
- LightGBM  


## Usage

1. Navigate to the specific algorithm folder.  
2. Open and run the Jupyter notebook to understand the implementation and experiment with the code.  
3. Refer to the README in each folder for detailed explanations and additional resources.

## Dependencies
