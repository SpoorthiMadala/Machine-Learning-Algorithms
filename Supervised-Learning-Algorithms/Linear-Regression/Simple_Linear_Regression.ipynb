    "## Conclusion: Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment, we used **Simple Linear Regression** to model the relationship between **median income (`MedInc`)** and **median house prices** in California.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "- The regression model successfully captured a general **positive correlation** between income and housing prices.\n",
    "- Performance evaluation metrics:\n",
    "  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures average squared difference between actual and predicted values.\n",
    "  - **R-squared (R²) Score**: Indicates how much of the variance in house prices is explained by median income.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only a **single feature (`MedInc`)** was used, while real-world house prices depend on many factors such as **location, population, house age**, etc.\n",
    "- This model is **too simplistic** for accurate predictions but is effective for understanding linear relationships and model-building fundamentals.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we will implement **Multiple Linear Regression** using all features to build a more robust and informative model.\n"
