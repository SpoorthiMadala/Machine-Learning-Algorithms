# Linear Regression

## Overview

Linear Regression is a fundamental supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. It assumes a linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables.

## Theory

The model estimates the coefficients of the linear equation:

\[
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \cdots + \beta_n x_n + \epsilon
\]

where:  
- \(y\) is the dependent variable (target).  
- \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) are the independent variables (features).  
- \(\beta_0\) is the intercept.  
- \(\beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_n\) are the coefficients for each feature.  
- \(\epsilon\) is the error term.

The goal is to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals (differences between observed and predicted values).
