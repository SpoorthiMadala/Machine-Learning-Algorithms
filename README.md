# Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository provides a comprehensive collection of well-documented Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the implementation of fundamental and advanced machine learning algorithms. The goal of this project is to offer an educational resource that combines theoretical explanations with practical code examples.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main categories:

- **Supervised Learning**  
  Algorithms trained on labeled data to perform regression and classification tasks.

- **Unsupervised Learning**  
  Algorithms that identify patterns or structures in unlabeled data.

- **Reinforcement Learning**  
  Algorithms that learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative reward.

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate notebook and organized in a structured folder hierarchy. Every algorithm folder contains:
- A dedicated Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`)
- An individual `README.md` file with explanation, mathematical background, and use cases
